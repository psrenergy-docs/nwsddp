* Inclusion of a new MDC file for PMO cases as of April/2016.


# Version 3.4.3

# Version 3.3

## New features

* Fixed an error in converting fuel data to zero defined cost fuels for the entire study horizon. These fuels were not converted to SDDP and the database was inconsistent.


# Version 3.2

## New features

* The conversion of the time-varying minimum flow (minimum flow) data, associated with the VAZMINT parameter of the MODIF.DAT file, was included.


# Version 3.1

  * Option for seed 33013 (SEED 33013) disabled.


# Version 3.0

## New features

* Changes related to the details of waterfalls through the external file for modification of the NEWAVE register (file NWSDDP.MDC):
  * A new functionality was added to the interface that allows the management of different NWSDDP.MDC files (which may contain differences to adapt to different NEWAVE cases). These files will be part of the NwSddp converter installation and the file to be used can be selected at the time of data conversion. In addition, a functionality was also created to download MDC files that will be published in the future by PSR.
  * Some additional loads defined in the Newave data should not be added to the demand as they are, for example, submotors already considered in the individualized SDDP model and, if they were considered, there would be a double counting in the demand of the corresponding systems. A new field has been included that, if informed, obligatorily defines for all additional loads whether or not it should be considered in the conversion process.
  * A field was included to define chronological minimum runoff data, which allows for detailed modeling of the Belo Monte and Belo Monte Complementar plants.
  * Extension of the reading of the modification data of the hydroelectric plants register to consider the field ‚ÄúAverage leakage channel‚Äù.
* New option that indicates that the file VAZOESC.DAT (flows from the DECOMP model) should be considered instead of the file VAZOES.DAT (flows from the NEWAVE model).
* The writing of fuel data considering the most current SDDP format was implemented. The initial step of converting these data indicated by the SDDP graphical interface will no longer be necessary when opening a case newly created by the converter.
* Verification of duplicate small power plant data has been included.
* Check was included to define penalty for minimum operating volume restrictions as default SDDP in cases where the accumulated production factor of downstream plants is less than zero (pumps).
* Changed formats of generated files and order of elements in order to ensure compatibility with the format used by the SDDP graphical interface when saving data.


# Version 2.8

## New features

* Reading and conversion of additional load data was implemented. The demand of the additional loads is incorporated into the demand of the corresponding system.
* The need for a hydrological station file (POSTOS.DAT) was removed. If there is any inconsistency in the file or it does not exist, the converter will use the name of the associated hydroelectric plant as the name of the station.
* Added an option to automatically correct duplicate names for systems, hydroelectric plants, thermal plants and hydrological stations. If this option is disabled (default option) the program displays a message that allows the user to enter new names for the elements.
* The converter identifies pairs of hydroelectric plants located in different systems and associated with the same hydrological station. For each pair, the unpowered plant is automatically considered as dummy and is removed from the configuration. In addition, the real power plant is connected to the dummy power plant's system cascade. If both plants do not have motorization, the converter will try to identify the fictitious plant through the presence of the FIC marker in its name. If this marker is found, the converter will ask the user to confirm that the plant is, in fact, fictitious.
* Added protection for reading total energy market data in inconsistent format.


# Version 2.7

## New features

* The extension of the Risk Aversion Curve reading was implemented with the option ‚ÄúPenalty in the minimum volume‚Äù. When this option is selected, the CAR is not represented by system and the minimum operative volume data are penalized based on the CAR cost indicated for each system and the plant's average accumulated production factor.
* There is a limitation of Newave, which requires that real systems must have at least one hydroelectric plant in operation at all stages of the study. Due to this, EPE made, in the 2019 Decennial Plan, a special model for the Belo Monte, Tapaj√≥s and others plants, which includes a fictitious machine with a power equal to 1 MW and maximum turbine power equal to 1 m3/s entering the setup start. An option was created that aims to try to identify these plants and correct the configuration in the creation of the SDDP database. This option can be selected by the user in the ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù screen in the interface.
* Added a check on the consistency between the power of machines added in the hydroelectric expansion file (EXPH.DAT) and the hydroelectric plant registration file (HIDR.DAT).
* The maximum turbocharging of hydroelectric plants considered for the calculation of the table of ‚Äúoutflow ÔÇ¥ tailrace level‚Äù is now based on the highest turbine value over the entire study horizon.

## Corrections

* The printing format of the interconnection coefficients in the interchange sum restrictions has been corrected.
* Fixed an error in the initialization of the number of machines of existing hydroelectric plants with expansion, which caused, in some cases, the number of machines, the total power and the maximum tur-bination of the plant to be above the correct value.
* An error in printing the flow history file has been fixed.


# Version 2.6

## New features

* As of this version, the NwSddp converter considers the conversion of Newave version 14 data as the default option. An option has been included for converting data in the format of previous versions, which can be selected in the ‚ÄúOptions > Execution Options‚Äù screen in the interface from NwSddp. The difference between the versions consists in the fact that the data from versions prior to 14 admit data of ‚Äútime-variable deficit cost‚Äù, whose file name is indicated in record 31 of the ‚Äúarquivos.dat‚Äù file. In turn, data from versions after 14 indicate in the same record the data file of "grouping of interchanges".
* Conversion of exchange aggregation data has been included. These data, present in Newave from version 14 onwards, are converted to SDDP and represented as sum restrictions of exchange flows.
* The maximum flow point for creating the table "exhaust channel height x flow" is now obtained as a function of the maximum flow in the history.
* The ‚ÄúArea‚Äù (constant) field, used by SDDP to calculate the evaporation of run-of-river plants, is now also calculated for the other plants.

## Corrections

* Treatment for reading hydroelectric expansion data was introduced because an error occurred in the NwSddp if the hydroelectric expansion data had an inconsistent format. As of this version, a message is informed indicating the inconsistent record in case of error.
