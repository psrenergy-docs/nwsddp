## Fixes

* Updates Thermal plant minimum generation file format for Sddp 17.2, fixing a bug that this constraint could be ignored.


# Version 3.6.15

## Updates

* Adds interconnection modification tolerance option. This new tolerance, with default value of 2 MW, controls how many interconnection modifications are created. If two consecutive modification values are below this specified tolerance, no modification are created on Sddp database.

* Increases minimum and maximum number of convergence iterations from 8 to 12.


# Version 3.6.13

## Fixes

* Fix hydroplants association with equivalent reservoirs (REE).


# Version 3.6.12

## Fixes

* Update hydroplants modifications file format.

* Adds registry modification file (MDC) for September 2022 PMO. This MDC explicitly disables Candonga hydroplant.

## New features

* The conversion process will ignore the registry modification file (MDC) if the option to use it is left unchecked. Previous versions would use any residual/existing MDC file in the input case folder.


# Version 3.6.11

## Fixes

* Fix hydroplants association with equivalent reservoirs (REE).

* Fix penalty fixed cost units when using the option to consider Newave's penalty values.

  * When the penalty cost entered in GHMIN in penalid.dat is 0 R$/MWh, it will be considered automatic calculation on Sddp.


# Version 3.6.10

## New features

* Adds registry modification file (MDC) for PDE 2031.


# Version 3.6.9

## New features

* Adds registry modification file (MDC) for August 2022 PMO. This case has an additional load in the North region not considered in previous MDCs.

## Fixes

* Fix a bug where incomplete error messages were shown.


# Version 3.6.8

* The `index.dat` file generated by the converter has been updated. Basically, this is the SDDP file that contains the definition of the output list to be generated by the model at the end of execution.


# Version 3.6.7

## Fixes

* Warns when there is a modification of a non-existing plant instead of
  showing error and interrupting the conversion.


# Version 3.6.6

## Fixes

* Registers components required during installation in order to run the program.

* The maximum number of interconnection aggregation modifications has been increased.
* New registry modification file (MDC) for the 2023 Decennial Expansion Plan (Plano Decenal de Expans√£o - PDE 2023).

# Version 3.4

* The conversion of the time-variable Forced Outage Equivalent Rate ("Taxa Equivalente de Indisponibilidade For√ßada - TEIF" in portuguese) data, defined in the `EXPT.DAT` file through the `TEIFT` parameter, was included.


# Version 3.3

## New features

* Fixed an error in converting fuel data to zero defined cost fuels for the entire study horizon. These fuels were not converted to SDDP and the database was inconsistent.

# Version 3.2

## New features

* The conversion of the time-varying minimum defluence (minimum flow) data, associated with the `VAZMINT` parameter of the `MODIF.DAT` file has been included.

# Version 3.1

## New features

* The conversion of the parameters associated with the CVaR aversion risk methodology has been included
* The following default parameters for SDDP execution were changed:
  * Number of series changed from 80 to 200
  * Maximum number of iterations changed from 7 to 8

  * New option to use absolute seed set as default.
  * Option related the 33013 seed (`SEED 33013`) has been disabled.

# Version 3.0

## New features

* Changes related to the details of waterfalls through the external file for modification of the NEWAVE register ( `NWSDDP.MDC` file):
  * A new functionality was added to the interface that allows the management of different `NWSDDP.MDC` files (which may contain differences to adapt to different NEWAVE cases). These files will be part of the NwSddp converter installation and the file to be used can be selected at the time of data conversion. In addition, a functionality was also created to download MDC files that will be published in the future by PSR.
  * Some additional loads defined in the Newave data should not be added to the demand because they are, for example, sub-engines already considered in the individualized model of the SDDP and, if they were considered, there would be a double counting in the demand of the corresponding systems. A new field has been included that, if informed, obligatorily defines for all additional loads whether or not it should be considered in the conversion process.
  * A field was included to define chronological minimum defluence data, which allows for detailed modeling of the Belo Monte and Belo Monte Complementar plants.
  * Extension of the reading of the modification data of the hydroelectric plants register to consider the field ‚ÄúAverage Tailwater‚Äù.
* New option that indicates that the `VAZOESC.DAT` file (inflows from the DECOMP model) should be considered instead of the `VAZOES.DAT` file (inflows from the NEWAVE model).
* The writing of fuel data considering the most current SDDP format was implemented. The initial step of converting these data indicated by the SDDP graphical interface will no longer be necessary when opening a case newly created by the converter.
* Verification of duplicate small power plant data was included.
* A verification to define penalty for minimum operating storage constraints as default SDDP, in cases where the accumulated production factor of downstream plants is less than zero (pumps), was included.
* Changed formats of generated files and order of elements in order to ensure compatibility with the format used by the SDDP graphical interface when saving data.

# Version 2.8

## New features

* Reading and conversion of additional load data was implemented. The demand of the additional loads is incorporated into the demand of the corresponding system.
* The need for a hydrological station file (`POSTOS.DAT`) was removed. If there is any inconsistency in the file or it does not exist, the converter will use the name of the associated hydroelectric plant as the name of the station.
* Added an option to automatically correct duplicate names for systems, hydroelectric plants, thermal plants and hydrological stations. If this option is disabled (default option) the program displays a message that allows the user to enter new names for the elements.
* The converter identifies pairs of hydroelectric plants located in different systems and associated with the same hydrological station. For each pair, the unpowered plant is automatically considered as a ficticious plant and is removed from the configuration. In addition, the real power plant is connected to the cascade of the ficticious power plant's system. If both plants do not have motorization, the converter will try to identify the fictitious plant through the presence of the 'FIC' marker in its name. If this marker is found, the converter will ask the user to confirm that the plant is truly fictitious.
* Added protection for reading total energy market data in inconsistent format.

# Version 2.7

## New features

* The extension of the Risk Aversion Curve (Curva de Avers√£o a Risco - CAR) reading was implemented with the option ‚ÄúPenalty in the minimum storage‚Äù. When this option is selected, the 'CAR' is not represented by system and the minimum operative storage data are penalized based on the CAR cost indicated for each system and the plant's average accumulated production factor.
* There is a limitation of Newave, which requires that real systems must have at least one hydroelectric plant in operation at all stages of the study. Due to this, EPE (Energy Planning Company) made, in the 2019 Decennial Plan, a special model for the Belo Monte, Tapaj√≥s and others plants, which includes a fictitious machine with a power equal to 1 MW and maximum turbine power equal to 1 m3/s entering the setup start. An option that aims to try to identify these plants and correct the configuration in the creation of the SDDP database was created. This option can be selected by the user in the ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù screen in the interface.
* A verification on the consistency between the power of machines added in the hydroelectric expansion file (`EXPH.DAT`) and the hydroelectric plant registration file (`HIDR.DAT`) was added.
* The maximum turbining outflow of hydroelectric plants considered for the calculation of the table Total Outflow x Tailwater Elevation is now based on the highest turbine value over the entire study horizon.

## Fixes

* The printing format of the interconnection coefficients in the constraints of sum of interconnection was fixed.
* It was fixed an error in the initialization of the number of machines of existing hydroelectric plants with expansion, which caused, in some cases, the number of machines, the total power and the maximum turbining outflow of the plant to be above the correct value.
* It was fixed an error in printing of the inflow history file.

# Version 2.6

## New features

* As of this version, the NwSddp converter considers the conversion of Newave version 14 data as the default option. An option has been included for converting data in the format of previous versions, which can be selected through the `Op√ß√µes > Op√ß√µes de execu√ß√£o` (‚ÄúOptions > Execution Options‚Äù) screen in the interface of NwSddp. The difference between the versions consists in the fact that the data from versions prior to 14 admit data of ‚Äútime-variable deficit cost‚Äù, whose file name is indicated in record 31 of the `arquivos.dat` file. In turn, data from versions after 14 indicate in the same record the data file of "grouping of interconnections".
* Conversion of interconnections aggregation data has been included. These data, present in Newave from version 14 onwards, are converted to SDDP and represented as constraints of sum of interconnections flows.
* The maximum total outflow point for creating the `Total Outflow x Tailwater Elevation` table is now obtained as a function of the maximum inflow in the history.
* The `Area` (constant) field, used by SDDP to calculate the evaporation of run-of-river plants, is now also calculated for the other plants.

## Fixes

* The treatment for reading hydroelectric expansion data was introduced because an error occurred in the NwSddp if the hydroelectric expansion data had an inconsistent format. As of this version, a message is informed indicating the inconsistent record in case of error.
